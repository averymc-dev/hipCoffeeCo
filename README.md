## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This project was built for a 'coming near you' coffee shop. It is built using MERN stack, with Passport providing the authentication, and hosted by Heroku. Accounts can be created for new team members, which allows their name to be attached to orders they place. Orders are put in to a 'basket' before the total is verified and sent to the barista.

## Optimizations

- Making the site responsive to smaller screens
- Decreasing load times
- Add customers name to order

## Lessons Learned:

- Emphasis placed on correct paths for CSS in HTML using EJS
- Locating and using flavico browser tab icon
- Authentication with Passport
